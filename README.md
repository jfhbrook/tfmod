# tfmod

- [publishing a public module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/modules/publish)
- [standard module structure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure)
- [terraform registry http api](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/api-docs)
  - it looks like it doesn't support creating/publishing a module, might need
    to get creative
  - potentially worth writing a Python client library for it anyway, though?
- [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)
  - can set the repository description
  - can potentially create the repository if it doesn't exist
- [pygit2](https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2)
  - or just shell out to git lol
- [python-hcl2](https://pypi.org/project/python-hcl2/)
- [go-flag](https://github.com/jfhbrook/go-flag)
  - doesn't have particular support for positional args. I'm not sure how
    terraform solves that - terraform *does* use the flag package, as far as
    I know
